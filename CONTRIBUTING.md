Any contribution is very welcome.

For example, if you find a typo, a better way to formulate a sentence or if you have stylistic improvements, the first step is to fork the repository.
Then you can make some changes and create a pull request.

If you are interested in a bigger contribution, like writing a chapter or providing examples: that's great! Please open an issue on Github and we can discuss your ideas.

Rules for contributing text or code:

- Make sure each text line only contains one sentence. Exception: for item lists it is one item (with possibly multiple sentences) per line.
- Fork the repository and open a pull request (PR) for requesting to include the changes. You can use "[WIP]" in the title of the PR, to indicate that you are still working on it
